# ChatView
This is a UI-only version of [Haik Aslanyan's Quick Chat][quickchat].

This project has zero dependencies. It simply demonstrates how build a UI similar to the Messages app with a UITableView. I focused on clean-code and MVP features. As such, I removed support for sending media messages and geolocations.
